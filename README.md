# Desktop Up And Running (DUAR)
WELCOME TO DUAR (Desktop Up And Running).

This script will attempt to install a customized Openbox
desktop. It is loosely based off #! (Crunchbang).

We assume that you installed Ubuntu Mini (14.10) and are now running this
script to get a simple desktop up and running.
