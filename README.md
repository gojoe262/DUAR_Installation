## Desktop Up And Running (DUAR)
WELCOME TO DUAR (Desktop Up And Running).

This script will attempt to install a customized [Openbox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page) desktop. It is loosely based off #! ([Crunchbang](http://crunchbang.org/)).

We assume that you installed Ubuntu Mini (14.10) and are now running this script to get a simple desktop up and running.
