RUN EACH ONE OF THESE AFTER THE DUAR INSTALLATION SCRIPT IS DONE. 

=====INSTALL MICROSOFT FONTS=====
	Open the terminal (Mod + t)
	Download and run the installer:
		sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer
	Hit tab to cycle through options and hit ok and agree.
	
	This will fix text not showing up on KSP


=====ADDING SUDOERS=====
	Allows non-root user to poweroff, reboot, suspend, etc.
	run 'visudo' as root
	add the following to the end of the file:
		
		ALL  ALL=NOPASSWD:/sbin/poweroff
		ALL  ALL=NOPASSWD:/sbin/reboot
		ALL  ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/pm-suspend
		ALL  ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/local/bin/mountPartitions.sh
		
=====SHOW BOOT MESSAGES ON START UP=====
	You would need to edit the file /etc/default/grub. In this file 
	you'll find an entry called GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT. This 
	entry must be edited to control the display of the splash screen.
	
	The presence of the word splash in this entry enables the splash
	screen, with condensed text output. Adding quiet as well, results 
	in just the splash screen; which is the default for the desktop 
	edition since 10.04 (Lucid Lynx). In order to enable the "normal"
	text start up, you would remove both of these.

	So, the default for the desktop, (i.e. splash screen only):
		GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"

	For the traditional, text display:
		GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=

	After editing the file, you need to run update-grub.
		sudo update-grub
		
=====PLYMOUTH-UPSTART-BRIDGE=====
	In Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 14.10, there seems to be a problem loading 
	plymouth-upstart-bridge. This can be seen during the boot process (if 
	boot messages are enable).
		plymouth-upstart-bridge main process (387) terminated with status 1	
	
	To fix this issue add 'sleep 2' to the end of 
	/etc/init/plymouth-upstart-bridge.conf. This will hopefully resolve the issue.		
		
		sudo nano /etc/init/plymouth-upstart-bridge.conf
		
		-Then add 
			sleep 2
		to the end of the file.
