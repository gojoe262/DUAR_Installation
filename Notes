=====SLIM===== 
Change Slim Theme
	Copy (as root) any background you like to /usr/share/slim/themes/archbang.
	Make sure your picture is named background.png or it won't work.
	If you would like another theme, just copy (as root), any theme folder to /usr/share/slim/themes.
	Edit /etc/slim.conf and change current_theme to your new theme.


=====ADDING SUDOERS=====
	run 'visudo' as root
	add the following to the end of the file:
		
		ALL  ALL=NOPASSWD:/sbin/poweroff
		ALL  ALL=NOPASSWD:/sbin/reboot
		ALL  ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/pm-suspend
		
		
=====COPY COMMAND=====
	Copies a file to the DestinationFolder. If there are any
	files that contain the same name, save the old one with the 
	suffix '.backup'

		cp cb-lock DestFolder/ --backup --suffix=.backup
		

=====SHOW BOOT MESSAGES ON START UP=====
	You would need to edit the file /etc/default/grub. In this file 
	you'll find an entry called GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT. This 
	entry must be edited to control the display of the splash screen.
	
	The presence of the word splash in this entry enables the splash
	screen, with condensed text output. Adding quiet as well, results 
	in just the splash screen; which is the default for the desktop 
	edition since 10.04 (Lucid Lynx). In order to enable the "normal"
	text start up, you would remove both of these.

	So, the default for the desktop, (i.e. splash screen only):
		GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"

	For the traditional, text display:
		GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=

	After editing the file, you need to run update-grub.
		sudo update-grub
