=====ADDING SUDOERS=====
	run 'visudo' as root
	add the following to the end of the file:
		
		ALL  ALL=NOPASSWD:/sbin/poweroff
		ALL  ALL=NOPASSWD:/sbin/reboot
		ALL  ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/pm-suspend
		ALL  ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/local/bin/mountPartitions.sh
		
=====CONNECTING TO A WIRED/WIRELESS NETWORK COMMAND LINE=====
	To view available network interfaces
		sudo /sbin/ifconfig  
		sudo /sbin/iwconfig

	WIRED (not sure if this will actually work):
	Edit /etc/network/interfaces to have:
		auto eth0
		iface eth0 inet dhcp

	Restart the networking
		sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart

	Run dhclient:
		sudo dhclient eth0

	
	WIRELESS

=====SLIM===== 
Change Slim Theme
	Copy (as root) any background you like to /usr/share/slim/themes/archbang.
	Make sure your picture is named background.png or it won't work.
	If you would like another theme, just copy (as root), any theme folder to /usr/share/slim/themes.
	Edit /etc/slim.conf and change current_theme to your new theme.

		
=====COPY COMMAND=====
	Copies a file to the DestinationFolder. If there are any
	files that contain the same name, save the old one with the 
	suffix '.backup'

		cp cb-lock DestFolder/ --backup --suffix=.backup

=====SHOW BOOT MESSAGES ON START UP=====
	You would need to edit the file /etc/default/grub. In this file 
	you'll find an entry called GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT. This 
	entry must be edited to control the display of the splash screen.
	
	The presence of the word splash in this entry enables the splash
	screen, with condensed text output. Adding quiet as well, results 
	in just the splash screen; which is the default for the desktop 
	edition since 10.04 (Lucid Lynx). In order to enable the "normal"
	text start up, you would remove both of these.

	So, the default for the desktop, (i.e. splash screen only):
		GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"

	For the traditional, text display:
		GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=

	After editing the file, you need to run update-grub.
		sudo update-grub


=====PLYMOUTH-UPSTART-BRIDGE=====
	In Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 14.10, there seems to be a problem loading 
	plymouth-upstart-bridge. This can be seen during the boot process (if 
	boot messages are enable).
		plymouth-upstart-bridge main process (387) terminated with status 1	
	
	To fix this issue add 'sleep 2' to the end of 
	/etc/init/plymouth-upstart-bridge.conf. This will hopefully resolve the issue.		
		sudo nano /etc/init/plymouth-upstart-bridge.conf
		-Then add 
			sleep 2
		to the end of the file.
		
		
=====SPEED UP START TIME WITH GRUB PROFILING=====
open your grub configuration file (/etc/default/grub) and find this line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash”, do as follows :
    sudo gedit /etc/default/grub
    replace GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash” with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash profile”.
    save and exit
    sudo update-grub2
    sudo reboot

Grub does a search for all the necessary drivers to load, Instead of making Grub search for required drivers, the profiling actually makes Grub remember every necessary driver to work, This action will cutting down all of the driver load times. 

after your system up, edit /etc/default/grub and remove some option which we have added before.
    sudo gedit /etc/default/grub
    replace GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash profile” with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash”.
    save and exit
    sudo update-grub2
		
		
=====TINT WIZARD====
	GUI Editor for tint2
	https://code.google.com/p/tintwizard/
	
	Place the tintwizard.py in /usr/local/bin
	Add openbox menu entry 
		Name: Tint Wizard
		Exec: tintwizard.py ~/.config/tint2/tint2rc
	
	
=====INSTALLING APPS=====
	1. 	When installing apps (such as Qt Creator) put this in the /opt directory.
	
	2. 	Either add the application's bin directory to path.
			This is done by editing the '/etc/profile' file. 
			Add these lines to the end of '/etc/profile':
				PATH=$PATH:/opt/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/bin
				export PATH

		OR create a symlink in '/usr/local/bin' to the application's executable file:
			ln -s /opt/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/bin/qtcreator.sh /usr/local/bin/qtcreator
	
	3. Now the application can be opened with a simple command
